A) The "reality" scenario // Realistic sales figures, prices and quantity of installation companies
   Q: Where are we now? What will happen in the heat pump industry if we continue as we are? Will we achieve our climate targets?
   A01: Reality with currently high electricity costs
   A11: Effect of max_sales
   A12: Effect of limited workforce
B) The "unlimited time" scenario // Increased time horizon
   Q: When will we reach return on investment for the vast majority of German dwellings?
   B01: Time horizon of 5 years
   B02: Time horizon of 10 years
   B03: Time horizon of 15 years
   B04: Time horizon of 20 years
   B05: Time horizon of 25 years
C) The "perfect heat pump(s)" scenario // What size of heat pump makes the most sense 
   Q: Does it make a difference if we limit ourselfes to only 3 heat pumps?
   C01: Comparing different COP with different costs
   (PS) C11 & C12: Running the code with 15 heat pumps vs Running the code with 3 heat pumps (one with high capacity, one with average capacity, one with low capacity)
D) The "saying goodbye to fossil fuels" scenario // Pure use of green electricity, very sharply rising gas prices and CO2 prices
   Q: Are rising prices a means to drive the electrification of the heating sector? To what extent is this the case?
   D01: slightly lower CO2_Factor, 50% increase in the yearly gas prices
   D02: CO2_Factor of 0 -> only green electricity, 100% increase in the yearly gas prices
E) The "boom in heating systems" scenario // Strongly increasing production volume and large growth in the labour force in the heat pump industry
   Q: Would we install more heat pumps if the capacities and infrastructure for them were better developed?
   (PS) E01: Increase workforce from 1.07 to 1.17
   E012: Increase workforce by 20% (Does the max_sales constraint get active here?)
   (PS) E02: Increase max_sales from 0.19 to 0.29
   (PS) E03: Increase workforce from 1.07 to 1.17 & Increase max_sales from 0.19 to 0.29
   E11: Where does the german-wide supplier travel the most? == where is the lack of workforce in comparison to the demand the biggest?
F) The "good use of tax money" scenario // Increase subsidies (via C02 prices, electicity subsidies and heat pump subsicies)
   Q: How does increased state funding (via C02 prices, electicity subsidies and heat pump subsicies) affect heat pump distribution
   F01: 50% increase in CO2 prices == funding green electricity + constant reality subsidies on the investment costs
   F02: 100% increase in CO2 prices + 80% subsidies in investment costs
G) The "unlimited money" scenario // The only restriction are the production volume and labour force -> No ROI considerd
   Q: How long does it take to install heat pumps in all existing buildings?
   G01: What Min_Percentage is possible?
H) The CO2 objective scenario:
   Q: How much CO2 can we save in our time horizon? What are the costs?
