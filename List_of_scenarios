A) The "reality" scenario // Realistic sales figures, prices and quantity of installation companies
   Q: Where are we now? What will happen in the heat pump industry if we continue as we are? Will we achieve our climate targets?
B) The "unlimited time" scenario // Increased time horizon
   Q: When will we reach return on investment for the vast majority of German dwellings?
C) The "perfect heat pump(s)" scenario // What size of heat pump makes the most sense 
   Q: Does it make a difference if we limit ourselfes to only 3 heat pumps? 
D) The "saying goodbye to fossil fuels" scenario // Pure use of green electricity, very sharply rising gas prices and CO2 prices
   Q: Are rising prices a means to drive the electrification of the heating sector? To what extent is this the case?
E) The "boom in heating systems" scenario // Strongly increasing production volume and large growth in the labour force in the heat pump industry
   Q: Would we install more heat pumps if the capacities and infrastructure for them were better developed?
F) The "good use of tax money" scenario // Increase subsidies (via C02 prices, electicity subsidies and heat pump subsicies)
   Q: How does increased state funding (via C02 prices, electicity subsidies and heat pump subsicies) affect heat pump distribution
